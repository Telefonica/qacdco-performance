# Prometheus Exporter Tool

This tool provides a new tool called Prometheus Exporter, which uses Prometheus, Pandas, and Plotly libraries to create an HTML dashboard of Prometheus metrics. It is packaged in a Docker container for easy deployment.

## Usage

To use the Prometheus Exporter, run the following command:

```bash
./initDocker.sh -u [prometheus-url] -a [authorization-header] -s [start-date] -e [end-date] -t [step] -q '[prometheus-query]'
```
This will build and run a Docker container with the specified parameters. The parameters are:

    -u: the URL of the Prometheus server to query
    -a: the authorization header to use when querying the Prometheus server
    -s: the start date of the query range in Unix timestamp format
    -e: the end date of the query range in Unix timestamp format
    -t: the step size of the query in seconds
    -q: the Prometheus query to run. This can be a single query or multiple queries separated by semicolons.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the project is as follows:

* exporter.sh: a shell script that collects input parameters and passes them to script/prometheus_chart_exporter.py
* initDocker.sh: a shell script that builds and runs a Docker container with the specified parameters
* docker/Dockerfile: the Dockerfile used to create the Docker container
* docker/requirements.txt: the requirements file for the Docker container, including the Plotly and Pandas libraries
* script/prometheus_chart_exporter.py: a Python script that collects input parameters and creates an HTML and JSON dashboard of the Prometheus queries.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the Prometheus Exporter tool:

```bash
    ./initDocker.sh -u https://prometheus.example.com/metrics -a "Basic [authorization]" -s 1679359438 -e 1679445838 -t 60 -q 'sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container="my-container"}[1m])) by (pod); sum(rate(container_memory_usage_bytes{container="my-container"}[1m])) by (pod)'
```
This will create a Docker container that queries the Prometheus server at `https://prometheus.example.com/metrics` with the provided authorization header, for the time range between `1679359438` and `1679445838`, with a step size of `60` seconds. The Prometheus queries used will be `sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container="my-container"}[1m])) by (pod); sum(rate(container_memory_usage_bytes{container="my-container"}[1m])) by (pod).`
