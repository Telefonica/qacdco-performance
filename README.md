The Performance Framework enables implementation of performance testing in a project using two different tools: Jmeter and Locust. Either of the two tools can be chosen to create a generic structure and begin designing test scenarios quickly.

In the locust folder, there is the Locust-oriented framework and the necessary information to get started can be found in the README.md file. Meanwhile, the Jmeter-based performance framework can be found in the jmeter folder.

Templates with basic structures are available to start developing performance scenarios, as well as examples of performance pipelines.


Please, have a look to the documentation in the following link [Performance Testing Framework](https://confluence.tid.es/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73025608) .This document will give to you a complete overview of the performance testing process, main performance testing tasks, and a guideline about the performance framework based on Jmeter or Locust.
